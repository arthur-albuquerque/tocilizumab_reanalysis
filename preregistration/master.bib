  abstract = {Patients with left main coronary artery disease have improved outcomes with coronary revascularization compared with medical therapy, but the choice of optimal revascularization technique is unresolved.To use bayesian methods to analyze the risk differences for patients with left main coronary artery disease randomized to treatment with coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) compared with those randomized to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in recent randomized clinical trials (RCTs).A systematic review using the PubMed database with the query string ``(left main disease) and (PCI or CABG) and (5-year follow-up) and (clinical trial)'' identified all RCTs from January 1996 to January 2020 comparing CABG to PCI for treatment of patients with left main coronary artery disease and with 5-year follow-up data. With the use of bayesian methods, the largest and most publicized RCT (EXCEL; Evaluation of XIENCE Versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization; 2019) was reanalyzed (1) as an isolated entity using noninformative priors and (2) in the context of previous knowledge using informative priors derived from similar trials. Published aggregate data were used with assignments from each trial following the original intention-to-treat principle. Combining EXCEL data with varying levels of prior information using Bayes theorem provided final (posterior) probability distributions for primary and secondary outcomes.A composite end point of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and stroke was the primary EXCEL outcome and was accordingly the primary outcome for this reanalysis. Secondary analyses were performed for isolated all-cause mortality and for the composite outcome along with repeated revascularization procedures.When EXCEL data were analyzed using the originally stated noninferiority design, the 5-year primary outcome difference reported (2.8\%; 95\% CI, -0.9\% to 6.5\%) exceeded the predefined 4.2\% noninferiority margin; thus, the null hypothesis of PCI inferiority could not be rejected. By contrast, the present bayesian analysis of the EXCEL primary outcome estimated 95\% probability that the 5-year primary outcome difference was increased with PCI compared with CABG and 87\% probability that this difference was greater than 1 extra event per 100 patients treated. Bayesian analyses also suggested 99\% probability that EXCEL total mortality was increased with PCI and 94\% probability that this absolute difference exceeded 1 extra deaths per 100 treated. A systematic review identified 3 other RCTs that studied the same question. The incorporation of this prior knowledge reduced the estimated probability of any excess mortality with PCI to 85\%. For the secondary composite end point, which also included repeated revascularizations, there were estimated probabilities of 98\% for at least 4 extra events and of 90\% for at least 5 extra events per 100 patients treated with PCI.Bayesian analysis assisted in RCT data interpretation and specifically suggested, whether based on EXCEL results alone or on the totality of available evidence, that PCI was associated with inferior long-term results for all events, including mortality, compared with CABG for patients with left main coronary artery disease.},

  abstract = {Bayesian analysis of clinical trial data may provide useful information to aid in study interpretation, especially when trial evidence suggests that the benefits of an intervention are uncertain, such as in a trial that evaluated early extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).To demonstrate the potential utility of Bayesian analyses by estimating the posterior probability, under various assumptions, that early ECMO was associated with reduced mortality in patients with very severe ARDS in a randomized clinical trial (RCT).A post hoc Bayesian analysis of data from an RCT (ECMO to Rescue Lung Injury in Severe ARDS [EOLIA]) that included 249 patients with very severe ARDS who had been randomized to receive early ECMO (n\,=\,124; mortality at 60 days, 35\%) vs initial conventional lung-protective ventilation with the option for rescue ECMO (n\,=\,125, mortality at 60 days, 46\%). The trial was designed to detect an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 20\%, relative risk (RR) of 0.67. Statistical prior distributions were specified to represent varying levels of preexisting enthusiasm or skepticism for ECMO and by Bayesian meta-analysis of previously published studies (with downweighting to account for differences and quality between studies). The RR, credible interval (CrI), ARR, and probability of clinically important mortality benefit (varying from RR less than 1 to RR less than 0.67 and ARR from 2\% or more to 20\% or more) were estimated with Bayesian modeling.Combining a minimally informative prior distribution with the findings of the EOLIA trial, the posterior probability of RR less than 1 for mortality at 60 days after randomization was 96\% (RR, 0.78 [95\% CrI, 0.56-1.04]); the posterior probability of RR less than 0.67 was 18\%, the probability of ARR of 2\% or more was 92\%, and the probability of ARR of 20\% or more was 2\%. With a moderately enthusiastic prior, equivalent to information from a trial of 264 patients with an RR of 0.78, the estimated RR was 0.78 (95\% CrI, 0.63-0.96), the probability of RR less than 1 was 99\%, the probability of RR less than 0.67 was 8\%, the probability of ARR of 2\% or more was 97\%, and the probability of ARR of 20\% or more was 0\%. With a strongly skeptical prior, equivalent to information from a trial of 264 patients with an RR of 1.0, the estimated RR was 0.88 (95\% CrI, 0.71-1.09), the probability of RR less than 1 was 88\%, the probability of RR less than 0.67 was 0\%, the probability of ARR of 2\% or more was 78\%, and the probability of ARR of 20\% or more was 0\%. If the prior was informed by previous studies, the estimated RR was 0.71 (95\% CrI, 0.55-0.94), the probability of RR less than 1 was 99\%, the probability of RR less than 0.67 was 48\%, the probability of ARR of 2\% or more was 98\%, and the probability of ARR of 20\% or more was 4\%.Post hoc Bayesian analysis of data from a randomized clinical trial of early extracorporeal membrane oxygenation compared with conventional lung-protective ventilation with the option for rescue extracorporeal membrane oxygenation among patients with very severe acute respiratory distress syndrome provides information about the posterior probability of mortality benefit under a broad set of assumptions that may help inform interpretation of the study findings.},

  abstract = {Summary There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

  abstract = {The use of evidence from clinical trials to support decisions for individual patients is a form of ``reference class forecasting'': implicit predictions for an individual are made on the basis of outcomes in a reference class of ``similar'' patients treated with alternative therapies. Evidence based medicine has generally emphasized the broad reference class of patients qualifying for a trial. Yet patients in a trial (and in clinical practice) differ from one another in many ways that can affect the outcome of interest and the potential for benefit. The central goal of personalized medicine, in its various forms, is to narrow the reference class to yield more patient specific effect estimates to support more individualized clinical decision making. This article will review fundamental conceptual problems with the prediction of outcome risk and heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE), as well as the limitations of conventional (one-variable-at-a-time) subgroup analysis. It will also discuss several regression based approaches to ``predictive'' heterogeneity of treatment effect analysis, including analyses based on ``risk modeling'' (such as stratifying trial populations by their risk of the primary outcome or their risk of serious treatment-related harms) and analysis based on ``effect modeling'' (which incorporates modifiers of relative effect). It will illustrate these approaches with clinical examples and discuss their respective strengths and vulnerabilities.},

By testing enough subgroups, a false-positive result will probably emerge by chance alone. Investigators might undertake many analyses but only report the significant effects, distorting the medical literature. In general, we discourage subgroup analyses. However, if they are necessary, researchers should do statistical tests of interaction, rather than analyse every separate subgroup. Investigators cannot avoid interim analyses when data monitoring is indicated. However, repeatedly testing at every interim raises multiplicity concerns, and not accounting for multiplicity escalates the false-positive error. Statistical stopping methods must be used. The O'Brien-Fleming and Peto group sequential stopping methods are easily implemented and preserve the intended {$\alpha$} level and power. Both adopt stringent criteria (low nominal p values) during the interim analyses. Implementing a trial under these stopping rules resembles a conventional trial, with the exception that it can be terminated early should a treatment prove greatly superior. Investigators and readers, however, need to grasp that the estimated treatment effects are prone to exaggeration, a random high, with early stopping.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Study Design and Setting: Based on opinions from 23 international experts, we determined the items considered most important when publishing a Bayesian analysis. We then performed a literature search to identify articles in which a Bayesian analysis was performed and determined the extent to which we found these items in each report. Finally, we examined the relationship between the number of items in a report and journal- and article-specific attributes. Results: Our final set of seven items described the prior distribution (specification, justification, and sensitivity analysis), analysis (statistical model and analytic technique), and presentation of results (central tendency and variance). There was Ͼ99\% probability that more items were reported in studies with a noncontrolled study design and in journals with a methodological focus, lower impact factor, and absence of a word count limit. Conclusion: We developed a set of seven items that experts believe to be most important when reporting a Bayesian analysis. \'C 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Setting Nine hospitals in Brazil, 8 May to 17 July 2020. Participants Adults with confirmed covid-19 who were receiving supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation and had abnormal levels of at least two serum biomarkers (C reactive protein, D dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, or ferritin). The data monitoring committee recommended stopping the trial early, after 129 patients had been enrolled, because of an increased number of deaths at 15 days in the tocilizumab group. Interventions Tocilizumab (single intravenous infusion of 8 mg/kg) plus standard care (n=65) versus standard care alone (n=64). Main outcome measure The primary outcome, clinical status measured at 15 days using a seven level ordinal scale, was analysed as a composite of death or mechanical ventilation because the assumption of odds proportionality was not met. Results A total of 129 patients were enrolled (mean age 57 (SD 14) years; 68\% men) and all completed follow-up. All patients in the tocilizumab group and two in the standard care group received tocilizumab. 18 of 65 (28\%) patients in the tocilizumab group and 13 of 64 (20\%) in the standard care group were receiving mechanical ventilation or died at day 15 (odds ratio 1.54, 95\% confidence interval 0.66 to 3.66; P=0.32). Death at 15 days occurred in 11 (17\%) patients in the tocilizumab group compared with 2 (3\%) in the standard care group (odds ratio 6.42, 95\% confidence interval 1.59 to 43.2). Adverse events were reported in 29 of 67 (43\%) patients who received tocilizumab and 21 of 62 (34\%) who did not receive tocilizumab. Conclusions In patients with severe or critical covid-19, tocilizumab plus standard care was not superior to standard care alone in improving clinical outcomes at 15 days, and it might increase mortality.

  abstract = {Importance: In December 2019, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, China. The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is limited. Objective: To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective, single-center case series of the 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was February 3, 2020. Exposures: Documented NCIP. Main Outcomes and Measures: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. Presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked. Results: Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3\%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29\%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3\%]). Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6\%]), fatigue (96 [69.6\%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4\%]). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8\,\texttimes\,109/L [interquartile range \{IQR\}, 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3\%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58\%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9\%). Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9\%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4\%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6\%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1\%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9\%]). Thirty-six patients (26.1\%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1\%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4\%]), and shock (11 [30.6\%]). The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the ICU (n\,=\,36), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n\,=\,102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2\%] vs 38 [37.3\%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9\%] vs 20 [19.6\%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7\%] vs 31 [30.4\%]). Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1\%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7\%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2\%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). As of February 3, 47 patients (34.1\%) were discharged and 6 died (overall mortality, 4.3\%), but the remaining patients are still hospitalized. Among those discharged alive (n\,=\,47), the median hospital stay was 10 days (IQR, 7.0-14.0). Conclusions and Relevance: In this single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP in Wuhan, China, presumed hospital-related transmission of 2019-nCoV was suspected in 41\% of patients, 26\% of patients received ICU care, and mortality was 4.3\%.},

  abstract = {When randomized trial results are available for several di erent groups of patients, neither applying the overall results to each type of patient nor using group-speci\"yc results is entirely satisfactory. Instead, we estimate group-speci\"yc treatment e ects using a Bayesian approach with informative priors for the treatment \texttimes{} group interactions. We describe how we elicited these prior beliefs about the e ects of a new drug for the treatment of heart failure in three di erent patient groups. Using results from three trials, one in each patient group, the posterior mean treatment e ects are very similar to the trialspeci\"yc maximum likelihood estimates, showing that in this case each trial e ectively stands by itself. Our methods can also be applied to subgroup analyses in a single clinical trial, where subgroup-speci\"yc posterior means are likely to lie between the subgroup-speci\"yc maximum likelihood estimates and the pooled maximum likelihood estimates.

  abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, due to the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused a worldwide sudden and substantial increase in hospitalizations for pneumonia with multiorgan disease. This review discusses current evidence regarding the pathophysiology, transmission, diagnosis, and management of COVID-19.SARS-CoV-2 is spread primarily via respiratory droplets during close face-to-face contact. Infection can be spread by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic carriers. The average time from exposure to symptom onset is 5 days, and 97.5\% of people who develop symptoms do so within 11.5 days. The most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Radiographic and laboratory abnormalities, such as lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase, are common, but nonspecific. Diagnosis is made by detection of SARS-CoV-2 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing, although false-negative test results may occur in up to 20\% to 67\% of patients; however, this is dependent on the quality and timing of testing. Manifestations of COVID-19 include asymptomatic carriers and fulminant disease characterized by sepsis and acute respiratory failure. Approximately 5\% of patients with COVID-19, and 20\% of those hospitalized, experience severe symptoms necessitating intensive care. More than 75\% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 require supplemental oxygen. Treatment for individuals with COVID-19 includes best practices for supportive management of acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Emerging data indicate that dexamethasone therapy reduces 28-day mortality in patients requiring supplemental oxygen compared with usual care (21.6\% vs 24.6\%; age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83 [95\% CI, 0.74-0.92]) and that remdesivir improves time to recovery (hospital discharge or no supplemental oxygen requirement) from 15 to 11 days. In a randomized trial of 103 patients with COVID-19, convalescent plasma did not shorten time to recovery. Ongoing trials are testing antiviral therapies, immune modulators, and anticoagulants. The case-fatality rate for COVID-19 varies markedly by age, ranging from 0.3 deaths per 1000 cases among patients aged 5 to 17 years to 304.9 deaths per 1000 cases among patients aged 85 years or older in the US. Among patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit, the case fatality is up to 40\%. At least 120 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are under development. Until an effective vaccine is available, the primary methods to reduce spread are face masks, social distancing, and contact tracing. Monoclonal antibodies and hyperimmune globulin may provide additional preventive strategies.As of July 1, 2020, more than 10 million people worldwide had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Many aspects of transmission, infection, and treatment remain unclear. Advances in prevention and effective management of COVID-19 will require basic and clinical investigation and public health and clinical interventions.},

  abstract = {Objective: Randomized trials generally use ``frequentist'' statistics based on P-values and 95\% confidence intervals. Frequentist methods have limitations that might be overcome, in part, by Bayesian inference. To illustrate these advantages, we re-analyzed randomized trials published in four general medical journals during 2004. Study Design and Setting: We used Medline to identify randomized superiority trials with two parallel arms, individual-level randomization and dichotomous or time-to-event primary outcomes. Studies with P ! 0.05 in favor of the intervention were deemed ``positive''; otherwise, they were ``negative.'' We used several prior distributions and exact conjugate analyses to calculate Bayesian posterior probabilities for clinically relevant effects. Results: Of 88 included studies, 39 were positive using a frequentist analysis. Although the Bayesian posterior probabilities of any benefit (relative risk or hazard ratio ! 1) were high in positive studies, these probabilities were lower and variable for larger benefits. The positive studies had only moderate probabilities for exceeding the effects that were assumed for calculating the sample size. By comparison, there were moderate probabilities of any benefit in negative studies. Conclusion: Bayesian and frequentist analyses complement each other when interpreting the results of randomized trials. Future reports of randomized trials should include both. \'O 2008 Elsevier Inc.
