## Getting started

In contrast to the analysis in our preprint (`/02_preprint/analyses`), we used [Stan](http://mc-stan.org) through the R package [brms](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/index.html) in this folder. Instructions to download RStan and brms can be found [here](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan.html) and [here](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms#how-do-i-install-brms), respectively.

Lastly, we use also used [CmdStanR](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/), a lightweight interface to Stan for R users, to fit our models. Here is the code to install it:

```
> repos <- c(CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org", cmdstanr = "https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/")
> options(repos = repos)
> install.packages("cmdstanr")
```

As mentioned in the main `README.md` of this repository, one could clone this repository and run the analysis in their computer. Yet, there is an easier option in case one is only interested in reading the `html` reports generated by RMarkdown.

If you open an RMarkdown html file in GitHub, it will not present the report in a readable manner. An interesting alternative is to copy the URL of the html file, and paste it in this website: [https://htmlpreview.github.io](https://htmlpreview.github.io). For example, the model diagnostics of our main Bayesian can be found in the `/03_updated_analyses_who/analyses/main_model.html` file.

So, one could copy the corresponding URL: https://github.com/arthur-albuquerque/tocilizumab_reanalysis/blob/master/03_updated_analyses_who/analyses/main_model.html

and paste it in the aforementioned website to visualize the report directly from their browser: [Report](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/arthur-albuquerque/tocilizumab_reanalysis/blob/master/03_updated_analyses_who/analyses/main_model.html)
