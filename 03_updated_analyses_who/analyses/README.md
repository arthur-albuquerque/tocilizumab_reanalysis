# Models

In this folder, we present all scripts in which we fitted and diagnosed our Bayesian models. We followed the [WAMBS checklist](https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/met0000065) to report the model diagnostics. There are 1 .Rmd (script) and 1 .html (output) files per subject. 

 Here is a brief description of each file:

- main_model
    - Main model assuming weakly informative, vague, or informative priors
- simulation_model
    - Model regarding simulation analysis for patients on invasive mechanical ventilation
