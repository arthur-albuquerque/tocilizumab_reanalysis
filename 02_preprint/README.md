## Getting started

As mentioned in the main `README.md` of this repository, one could clone this repository and run the analysis in their computer. Yet, there is an easier option in case one is only interested in reading the `html` reports generated by RMarkdown.

If you open an RMarkdown html file in GitHub, it will not present the report in a readable manner. An interesting alternative is to copy the URL of the html file, and paste it in this website: [https://htmlpreview.github.io](https://htmlpreview.github.io). For example, the main figures of our preprint can be found in the `/02_preprint/analyses/03_Main_Figures.html` file.

So, one could copy the corresponding URL: https://github.com/arthur-albuquerque/tocilizumab_reanalysis/blob/master/02_preprint/analyses/03_Main_Figures.html

and paste it in the aforementioned website to visualize the report directly from their browser: [Report](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/arthur-albuquerque/tocilizumab_reanalysis/blob/master/02_preprint/analyses/03_Main_Figures.html)

## Notes
 There were twelve .RData/.rds files that were too large (>50MB) to upload to GitHub. These files are essential to run these .Rmd scripts:

 - `/02_preprint/analyses/03_Figures_Draft.Rmd` 
 - `/02_preprint/analyses/04_Sensitivity_Analyses_Different_Priors.Rmd`
 - `/02_preprint/analyses/05_Sensitivity_Analyses_Different_Baseline_Risks.Rmd`
 - `/02_preprint/analyses/07_Hospital_Discharge_Varying_Baseline_Risk.Rmd`

We have uploaded these .RData/.rds files to [https://osf.io/veazj/](https://osf.io/veazj/). We then wrote code lines in these four .Rmd scripts to be able to load these .RData/.rds files directly from OSF without the need to save them into your computer. We used functions such as ``url()``,``gzcon()``, and ``readRDS()``, inspired by [this script](https://osf.io/73thx/) we found online.

The framework explained above works perfectly. Yet, it requires internet connection and we have experienced time-out issues while loading large files from OSF.
Thus, if one prefers to load the files from your computer, we suggest to download
these twelve .Rdata/.rds files from [https://osf.io/veazj/](https://osf.io/veazj/) and
save them in the `/02_preprint/output/data/analyses` folder of this repository in your computer.
Lastly, one would have to alter the scripts to load the files from the computer, and not from OSF.

In general, we suggest to stay with the framework which loads the .RData/.rds files from OSF.
